cfwheels-better-redirect
========================

A plugin for cfwheels. This is a fork of [BetterRedirects plugin](http://cfwheels.org/plugins/listing/17) by Clarke Bishop.
The difference is that it will add the <b>returnUrl</b> parameter in the url instead of using session.

Versions
========
v0.9
* Add functions to store / clear / get the params to and from session variable

v0.5
* Bug fix: if the route pattern has variables, it isn't redirected correctly.
